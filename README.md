# Hi there, I'm Logan! 👋

I'm a student at 42 LeHavre, passionate about coding, and always eager to learn and explore new technologies. Currently, my main focus is on C and C++, with a sprinkle of Python.

## 🚀 Projects

One of my favorite projects is **Fractol**, where I ventured into the mesmerizing realm of fractals. I drew Mandelbrot and some of Julia's sets. Check out some snapshots of the mandelbrot fractal below:
